# Jumpy

A simple web platformer

Started in April 2017,  Jumpy was one of my first ever big coding projects <3

On the 31st of December, 2021, I reworked the game to not rely on the monitor refresh rate.
As a result, the physics are slighly different from what they were originally.
The game is still beatable though (I checked).
Have fun :)
